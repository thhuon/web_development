/* 1. flex-direction: set the main axis direction of flex items
row (default): left to right
row-reverse: right to left
column: top to bottom
column-reverse: bottom to top   
*/
/* 2. justify-content: align items along the main axis
flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction
flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction
center: items are centered along the line
space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space (around) them
space-evenly: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space (between) them
*/
/* 3. align-items: align items along the cross axis
flex-start (default): items are aligned toward the start of the cross axis
flex-end: items are aligned toward the end of the cross axis
center: items are centered along the cross axis
baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align
*/
/* 4. flex-wrap: control whether the flex container is single-line or 
multi-line, and the direction of the cross axis
nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom
wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top
*/
/* 5. align-content: align the flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis,
similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis
flex-start: lines are packed to the start of the container
flex-end: lines are packed to the end of the container
center: lines are packed to the center of the container
space-between: lines are evenly distributed in the container; first line is at the start, last
line is at the end
space-around: lines are evenly distributed in the container with equal space (around) them
space-evenly: lines are evenly distributed in the container with equal space (between) them
*/
/* 6. gap: set the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns
column-gap: set the gap between columns
row-gap: set the gap between rows
gap: set both the row and column gaps
*/
/* 7. align-self: override the align-items value for a specific flex item
auto (default): the element inherits the value of align-items on the parent flex container
flex-start: the element is aligned to the start of the cross axis
flex-end: the element is aligned to the end of the cross axis
center: the element is centered along the cross axis
baseline: the element is aligned such as its baseline aligns with the baselines of other items
*/
/* 8. order: specify the order of individual flex items
Default value is 0. Items with the same order value are laid out in the source order.
Items with lower order values are displayed first.
Negative values are allowed.
